<h2 id="Warning">1 Server Consideration</h2>
<p><strong>Zikula can be upgraded to version 1.2.2 from any of the following versions: 1.1.0, 1.1.1 or 1.1.2.  If your installation is less than that, please upgrade to one of these versions before proceeding with these instructions.</strong></p>
<p>Before you begin your upgrade, there are some requirements and guidelines you should consider to make upgrading, installing, running, and securing Zikula easier. Please read the <a href="softwarerecommendations.html">Zikula software condsiderations document</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Upgrade120">2 Upgrading to Zikula 1.2.2</h2> 
<p>Please follow the steps below in order, and read each in detail before 
    proceeding.  Providing the instructions are followed exactly, the upgrade 
should proceed with no problems.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#Backup120">2.1 Backup your database and files</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Prepare120">2.2 Prepare your existing installation</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Run120">2.3 Run the upgrade</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Clean120">2.4 Clean up and additional configuration</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Backup120">2.1 Backup your database and files</h3>
<p>It is <strong>vital</strong> to backup your database and file system before proceeding
     with the upgrade. Upgrades cannot be rolled back, therefore the only solution
     is to restore from backup if problems occur. To backup your database, try
    using  a tool such as <a href="http://www.mysqldumper.de/en/">mysqldumper</a>, <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.org">phpMyAdmin</a> or
     alternately use SSH or your hosting control panel. Full instructions and
    tutorials on database backups can be found by searching the web and the documentation
    of your tool set.</p>
    <p style="color: red;">---&gt;You will need your <strong>original config/config.php</strong> later, so do NOT overwrite it or delete it, and keep it in a safe place.&lt;---</p>

<h3 id="Prepare120">2.2 Prepare your existing 1.1.1 installation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Login to your Zikula site with an administrator account. If you want, you
    can disable your site during the upgrade by changing the configuration in
    index.php?module=Settings&amp;type=admin.</li>
<li>Move the module system/legal to modules/legal.  If you have not customised the legal module you can
just delete it from the system/ folder.</li>
<li>If you have the Profile in the system/ directory, move the system/Profile to modules/Profile.  If you have not customised the Profile module you can
just delete it from the system/ folder.  If Profile is already in modules/ then ignore this step</li>

<li>Upload all files from the package you downloaded, copying over your files.</li>
<li>Replace config/config.php with the backup you made in step 2.1.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Run120">2.3 Run the upgrade</h3>
<p>Run the upgrade script upgrade.php and follow the steps as described. There
    is no real interaction needed other than clicking on 'next'. All database
    changes that are necessary will be done automatically. At the end you will
be redirected to your admin panel.</p>

<h3 id="Clean120">2.4 Clean up and additional configuration</h3>
<p>After a successful upgrade you can remove</p>
<ol>
    <li>the install folder and the files install.php and upgrade.php  from the root folder of your site.</li>
    <li>If you use your own themes, please note that themes now require specific header information which you must update to use the <em>lang</em>, <em>langdirection</em> and <em>charset</em> plugin tags.  Please refer to both andreas08's and voodoodolly's <em>master.htm</em> templates which have variations for XHTML 1.0 STRICT and HTML 1.1.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you disabled your site before starting the upgrade (see 2.2) you should
    re-enable it now.</p>
<h2 id="Caution">3 Caution</h2>
<p> It should be noted that Zikula does not support any modification of the core
    code or data structure. Zikula v1.2.2 has been designed to be flexible enough
    to avoid any need to modify the core, but if you find something missing that
    you believe could be of widespread use, please submit a feature request to
the feature request tracker at <a href="http://code.zikula.org/core">code.zikula.org/core</a>.</p>

<h2 id="FinalNote">4 Final Note</h2>
<p>Congratulations!  Your upgrade is complete.  We hope you enjoy using this 
new Zikula version.  If you have any comments, please use the feedback forum on <a href="http://community.zikula.org" title="The Zikula Community">http://community.zikula.org</a>.</p>

<p>Regards,<br />

The Zikula Team</p>
